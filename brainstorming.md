# Team 
## Ideas 
- Social Media App that allows students on campus to connect with each other 
- Fitness App that lets users track ther fitness goals and consistency with some AI integration that has a model the checks if the user is on track with their goals 
- Homework Tracker that reminds students of assignments they need to complete with a viewable calender. it would also have a social media aspect to it that lets students plan group sessions to complete assignments.
- Smart Campus Companion that crowdsources wait times for dining halls, labs, and printers, then builds the fastest walking route between classes based on your live schedule.
- Quest-Based Study Circles that auto-match classmates each week, unlock shared Pomodoro timers, and drop XP when everyone checks in on progress.
- EcoBite Challenge that pulls dining hall menus, tracks carbon-friendly choices, and issues weekend leftover-use prompts with a leaderboard for the lowest food waste.

## Idea Evaluations

### Social Media App
- Solves campus connection with recognizable features such as messaging, notifications, and study-group boards.
- Needs a differentiator (e.g., verified class channels or meetup planning) and tightly scoped feature set to stay manageable.

### AI Fitness App
- Eye-catching use of AI/ML for progress alerts, charts, and habit tracking.
- Requires a clear plan for data input (manual logs, mock wearable data) and explainable guidance so the AI feels credible.

### EcoBite Challenge
- Most unique concept: combines dining hall menus, carbon-friendly tracking, and weekend leftover prompts with a leaderboard.
- Main dependency is reliable menu data; fallback is user submissions or a seeded dataset, after which gamified streaks and push prompts are within scope.

## Final Decision
- Our team selected the AI Fitness App as the project to develop for this class.
