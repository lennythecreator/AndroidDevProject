## Idea Evaluations

### Social Media App
- Solves campus connection with recognizable features such as messaging, notifications, and study-group boards.
- Needs a differentiator (e.g., verified class channels or meetup planning) and tightly scoped feature set to stay manageable.

### AI Fitness App
- Eye-catching use of AI/ML for progress alerts, charts, and habit tracking.
- Requires a clear plan for data input (manual logs, mock wearable data) and explainable guidance so the AI feels credible.

### EcoBite Challenge
- Most unique concept: combines dining hall menus, carbon-friendly tracking, and weekend leftover prompts with a leaderboard.
- Main dependency is reliable menu data; fallback is user submissions or a seeded dataset, after which gamified streaks and push prompts are within scope.
