## Overview

### Description

AI Fitness App is a personal mobile coach for students who want structured accountability. It lets users set fitness goals, track workouts and habits, and receive AI-generated check-ins that highlight consistency, celebrate wins, and suggest next steps.

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Health & Fitness / Productivity
- **Mobile:** Phones are always with students, letting the app deliver at-the-moment nudges (push reminders, widget glance), quick photo logging via camera, and motion data capture without extra hardware.
- **Story:** “Busy students need a lightweight coach that nudges them toward realistic weekly goals.”
- **Market:** College students and young professionals who want accountability without a gym membership; can expand to broader wellness market.
- **Habit:** Daily reminder streaks, weekly AI recaps, and challenge badges to encourage recurrent use.
- **Scope:** Core experience centers on four screens (onboarding, dashboard, log, insights) that are feasible within the semester while still leaving room for optional integrations.
